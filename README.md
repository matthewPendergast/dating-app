# Overview

This is a solo project I worked on to learn full-stack web development. The idea of it was to create a functional dating app clone from the ground up that allows users to:
- Browse, match, and interact with artificial users
- Edit your own personal profile and have the changes persist locally
- Represent a real-world dating app in appearance and function

Although it is a full-stack project, the frontend is far more developed than the backend. Functionality for signing up and logging in does exist in the codebase, but I decided not to fully implement that capability for this project. I originally planned to expand the backend much more, but I have since moved on to other projects that better suit my current learning goals.

It was built with React, Tailwind, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, and it is hosted on Render. Please note, however, that the free tier of Render is fairly limited, and as such the project can take a minute or two to fully load. The website itself is not meant for real-world production--just to showcase a project that I have built.
