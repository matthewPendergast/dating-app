# Overview

This is a solo project I am working on to learn full-stack web and mobile app development, with plans to incorporate personalized AI conversational interactivity via an external API.

The idea of it is to create a functional dating app clone from the ground up that allows users to:
- Sign up securely and create a custom profile
- Browse, filter, and match with artificial users
- Message AI-generated users with distinct personalities and active hours

It is being built with React, Tailwind, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, and both the frontend and backend are currently hosted on Render.
