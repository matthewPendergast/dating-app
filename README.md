# Overview

This is a solo project I am working on to learn full-stack web development, with plans to incorporate personalized AI conversational interactivity via an external API.

The idea of it is to create a functional dating app clone from the ground up that allows users to:
- Sign up securely and create a custom profile
- Browse, filter, and match with artificial users
- Message AI-generated users with distinct personalities and active hours

It is being built with React, Tailwind, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, and both the frontend and backend are currently hosted on Render.

## Current Progress

As of April 2025, development is on pace to meet the anticipated completion date of June 2025.

Presently, the project is in the process of building out the core features of the "User Dashboard" interface, such as creating a custom profile, browsing the userbase, connecting with and messaging other users, and more. The Home page is intended to be a showcase of these features without requiring the visitor to sign up.

After the core features have been implemented, development will shift to restoring signup/login functionality and proper backend integration--which is projected to begin in the second half of April.
